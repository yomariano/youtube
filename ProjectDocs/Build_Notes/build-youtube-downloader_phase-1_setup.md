# YouTube Downloader - Phase 1: Setup & Implementation

## Task Objective
Convert HTML YouTube downloader to fully functional Next.js application with real video processing, translation, and download capabilities.

## Current State
- Single HTML file with beautiful glassmorphism UI
- Demo functionality that simulates download process
- No actual video processing or backend services

## Future State
- Next.js 15+ application with App Router
- Real YouTube video extraction using yt-dlp
- Video/audio processing with FFmpeg
- AI translation with OpenAI Whisper
- Clean frontend/backend separation
- Production-ready download functionality

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- [x] Create Next.js application structure
- [x] Set up frontend and backend separation
- [x] Configure TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up package.json with required dependencies

### 2. Frontend Conversion
- [x] Convert HTML to React components
- [x] Implement Tailwind CSS styling
- [x] Create proper TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Set up form handling and state management

### 3. Backend API Routes
- [x] Create /api/extract endpoint for YouTube info
- [x] Create /api/download endpoint for video processing
- [x] Create /api/translate endpoint for AI translation
- [x] Implement progress tracking system

### 4. Video Processing Services
- [x] Set up yt-dlp for YouTube extraction
- [x] Configure FFmpeg for video/audio conversion
- [x] Implement file management and cleanup
- [x] Add error handling and validation

### 5. AI Translation Integration
- [x] Set up OpenAI Whisper for transcription
- [x] Implement translation pipeline
- [x] Add subtitle generation
- [x] Integrate with download workflow

### 6. Testing & Production
- [ ] Test full download workflow

- [ ] Implement file cleanup
- [ ] Add rate limiting and security

## Updates
[2025-01-26] Initial project setup started
[2025-01-26] ✅ Complete Next.js application structure created
[2025-01-26] ✅ All components and services implemented
[2025-01-26] ✅ Frontend converted with glassmorphism design
[2025-01-26] ✅ Backend API routes created
[2025-01-26] ✅ Dependencies installed successfully

## Next Steps
1. **Install system dependencies**: FFmpeg and yt-dlp
2. **Set up environment variables**: Create .env.local with OpenAI API key
3. **Test the application**: Run `npm run dev` and test functionality
4. **Production deployment**: Configure for VPS or dedicated server

## Technical Notes
- TypeScript compilation warnings exist due to missing dependencies during build
- Optional dependencies will install when system requirements are met
- Video processing requires FFmpeg and yt-dlp to be installed on the system
- Translation features require a valid OpenAI API key
